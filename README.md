# Shadow and Skully - C++ Code#
This is the C++ backend for the summer project that I worked on, Shadow and Skully.
The game was built in Unreal Engine 4.22
It was built over 9 weeks where I worked full-time (40+ hours/week)

Before this, I had only worked in Unreal for appx. 3 months, so there was still a learning curve on my part.
I definately learned so much during the development of this project.
There are many things that I am proud of, but there are many more things that, if I could go back and re-do it, I would definately change.
I realize that it may seem weird for me to not fix it at this time, but I believe in keeping it how it is to showcase how much I have learned.

#Things to Note#
1) I was the only developer messing with the cpp-side, so my code was not reviewed or worked on by anyone else. I still attempted to keep it clean for readability, but that had the tendancy to go out the window during crunch time.
